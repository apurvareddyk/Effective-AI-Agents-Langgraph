# Effective AI Agent Design Patterns using LangGraph and CrewAI

## Project Overview
This repository contains code, Colab notebooks, and video walkthroughs that demonstrate how to build modular and scalable **AI agents** using modern frameworks such as **LangGraph** and **CrewAI**.

The project showcases several key agent design patterns inspired by the ["Building Effective Agents"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHCDrAbH_go&t=5s) series by LangChain, adapted and implemented using:
- üîπ **LangGraph** ‚Äî a stateful multi-agent orchestration library built on top of LangChain.
- üî∏ **CrewAI** ‚Äî a simple, modular framework for creating autonomous agent teams.

Each agent pattern includes:
- Step-by-step logic construction
- Execution trace with **LangSmith Studio**
- Equivalent implementation in CrewAI
- Side-by-side behavior comparisons

## Frameworks Demonstrated

This project leverages two complementary frameworks for LLM-based agent orchestration:

- **LangGraph**  
  - Enables graph-based execution of agents.
  - Tracks memory, conditional routing, and multi-agent coordination.
  - Integrated with LangSmith Studio for real-time traces and observability.

- **CrewAI**  
  - Focuses on modular task-based agent collaboration.
  - Useful for quick prototyping and team-based workflows.
  - Integrates with tools like Groq and LangChain agents.

## Key Features Demonstrated

### ‚úÖ LangGraph + LangSmith Studio
- Create stateful graphs of agents with memory and routing logic.
- Visualize execution traces and transitions using **LangSmith Studio**.
- Includes ReAct-based reasoning and tool invocation with feedback loops.

### ‚úÖ CrewAI Equivalent Implementations
- Build equivalent flows using `Agents`, `Tasks`, and `Crew`.
- Compose logic using modular roles and task prompts.
- Run the same pattern for comparative evaluation.

## Tips & Best Practices

- üîÅ **Reuse Chat Templates**: Ensure consistent formatting across LangGraph and CrewAI runs.
- üß† **Use LangSmith Traces**: Great for debugging node outputs and routing issues.
- üß™ **Experiment with Agents**: Swap tools, memory types, and tasks to observe behavior shifts.
- üí° **Compare Logs**: Run LangGraph and CrewAI side-by-side and analyze similarities/differences.
